Lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler . The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Ja\u00f6deog\u00eb\u2019 in the Seneca language . [ 1 ] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio , which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s . When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion , when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains . Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors.", "start_char": 0, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0001", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression , the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \" Arsenal of Democracy \", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. Native American era [ edit ] Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years. These are some important villages, most c. 1750s, and earlier sites. For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter , an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. [ 2 ] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks , about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture .", "start_char": 1860, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0002", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture .

Other tribes included the Lenape , who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee , who had migrated up from the south. [ 4 ] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and malaria , to which they had no immunity.

Other tribes were 165 Lenape , 162 Shawnee , 100 Wyandot , 40 Tisagechroami , and 15 Mohican . [ 6 ] Shannopin's Town , a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street.

Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area. [ 10 ] Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company , a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km 2 ) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland , the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River [ 11 ] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt.

Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton . In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track. The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.

The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw. [ 15 ] Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation [ 17 ] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh . The fort, named Fort Prince George , was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia.

The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity . These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754\u20131763), or, the Seven Years' War , a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.

[ 21 ] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford , from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13\u201314, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne .

But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne , he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt , named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder . He also named the settlement between the rivers, \"Pittsborough\" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh ). [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.

In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] : 148 After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War . The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.

Of these settlers, about a third were English-American , another third were Scotch-Irish , and the rest were Welsh , German and others. [ 23 ] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. [ 23 ] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves.

Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War , as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny. [ 4 ] With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix , the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.

Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver. [ 24 ] The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge , a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh .

Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states. [ 20 ] The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. [ 26 ] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe.

The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. [ 11 ] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.

Scots Irish leadership [ edit ] Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was \"largely Scotch Irish\". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and \"developed their own sense of uniqueness.\" [ 36 ] New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813\u20131908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family , which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806\u20131882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the \"Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.\" [ 37 ] Technology [ edit ] In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke -fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry . [ 33 ] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21\" gun. [ 38 ] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh.", "start_char": 23976, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0015", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process . [ 39 ] Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie , Henry Clay Frick , Charles M. Schwab , and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse 's advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon , with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa . [ 39 ] Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.

The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns. [ 43 ] Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift , according to Mosher (1995). Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted 's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town.", "start_char": 27584, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0017", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted 's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism , with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation . [ 44 ] A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley. It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.

Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s\u20131940s.

New immigrants and migrants [ edit ] Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side , Polish Hill , Bloomfield , and Squirrel Hill , home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.

[ 39 ] African Americans [ edit ] Further information: Great Migration (African American) The years 1916\u20131940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process: Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.", "start_char": 40315, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0024", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North. [ 65 ] The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area: Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the Pittsburgh Courier ); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated. [ 66 ] The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District . It became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays , often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s. [ 39 ] 1930s [ edit ] Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s, [ 67 ] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition .", "start_char": 42240, "strategy": "sentence"}, {"chunk_id": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh_0025", "source": "en.wikipedia.org_wiki_History_of_Pittsburgh.txt", "text": "As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition .

[ 68 ] [ 69 ] Joseph Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only \"a challenge\" but also \"an opportunity\". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage. [ 70 ] 1940s [ edit ] On October 1, 1940, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia . Pittsburgh was at the center of the \" Arsenal of Democracy \" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II . Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.

[ 72 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.

[ citation needed ] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products.

Higher education [ edit ] Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh , Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University . Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.

In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice. Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River , opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh) . Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people \u2013 teachers, students, adults, and visitors \u2013 to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.

Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon. [ 27 ] In the 1980s, the \"Renaissance II\" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place . In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared. [ 27 ] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened. [ 27 ] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park , despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League. [ 93 ] Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.

[ 95 ] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities. Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry. [ 96 ] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh. As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies. The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center. In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.

Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.

The French and Indian War , the North American front of the Seven Years' War , began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. [ 30 ] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field .

The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.

Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century [ edit ] During the late 2000s recession , Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them.

Prior to the American Civil War , Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party , [ 220 ] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression , combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election .

Freight rail [ edit ] Union Station , built in 1903 Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works , which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse 's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway 's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line , and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard , built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX , the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.
